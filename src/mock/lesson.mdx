# Domain of a Function

<Badge variant="secondary">Beginner</Badge>

The **domain** of a function is the set of all inputs that make the function meaningful. When a value breaks the expression, that value is not in the domain. Domain is not a side detail; it is part of the function itself.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Identify domain restrictions from common expression types.
2. Write domains using inequalities and interval notation.
3. Combine multiple restrictions correctly.
4. Check and explain why a value is included or excluded.

## Why domain matters

Most errors with functions happen before algebra starts. If you use an invalid input, every step after that can look clean but still be wrong.

A fast habit: before solving, graphing, or simplifying, ask:

1. What inputs make this undefined?
2. How do I represent the allowed inputs precisely?

## Formal definition

For a real-valued function:

$$
\operatorname{Dom}(f)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid f(x)\text{ is defined in }\mathbb{R}\}
$$

If the expression is not defined for some real number, that number is excluded.

## Core restriction rules

### Rule 1: Denominators cannot be zero

If an expression has a denominator, exclude values that make the denominator zero.

Example pattern:

$$
\frac{1}{g(x)}\quad\Rightarrow\quad g(x)\neq 0
$$

### Rule 2: Even roots need non-negative radicands

For square roots and other even roots:

$$
\sqrt{g(x)}\quad\Rightarrow\quad g(x)\ge 0
$$

(For real-valued functions.)

### Rule 3: Logarithm arguments must be positive

For logarithms:

$$
\log(g(x))\quad\Rightarrow\quad g(x)>0
$$

Zero and negative arguments are invalid.

## Interval notation refresher

| Statement | Interval |
| :--- | :--- |
| $x < a$ | $(-\infty, a)$ |
| $x \le a$ | $(-\infty, a]$ |
| $x > a$ | $(a, \infty)$ |
| $x \ge a$ | $[a, \infty)$ |
| Exclude one point $a$ | $(-\infty, a) \cup (a, \infty)$ |

Parentheses mean endpoint excluded. Brackets mean endpoint included.

## Standard process for finding domain

1. Write each restriction separately.
2. Solve each restriction.
3. Convert each result to interval form.
4. Intersect allowed sets (because all conditions must hold).
5. Remove explicitly forbidden points.
6. Quick-check with sample values.

## Worked examples

### Example 1: Rational function

Find the domain of:

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{x-3}
$$

Restriction:

$$
x-3\neq 0 \Rightarrow x\neq 3
$$

Domain:

$$
(-\infty,3)\cup(3,\infty)
$$

### Example 2: Square root function

Find the domain of:

$$
g(x)=\sqrt{x-5}
$$

Restriction:

$$
x-5\ge 0 \Rightarrow x\ge 5
$$

Domain:

$$
[5,\infty)
$$

### Example 3: Logarithmic function

Find the domain of:

$$
h(x)=\ln(2x+1)
$$

Restriction:

$$
2x+1>0 \Rightarrow x>-\frac{1}{2}
$$

Domain:

$$
\left(-\frac{1}{2},\infty\right)
$$

### Example 4: Mixed restrictions

Find the domain of:

$$
p(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-4}
$$

Restrictions:

$$
x-1\ge 0 \Rightarrow x\ge 1
$$

$$
x-4\neq 0 \Rightarrow x\neq 4
$$

Combine by intersection, then remove 4:

$$
[1,4)\cup(4,\infty)
$$

### Example 5: Radical in denominator

Find the domain of:

$$
q(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x+2}}
$$

Because the square root is in the denominator, it must be defined **and nonzero**:

$$
x+2>0
$$

Domain:

$$
(-2,\infty)
$$

### Example 6: Log of a rational expression

Find the domain of:

$$
r(x)=\ln\!\left(\frac{x-2}{x+5}\right)
$$

Need argument positive:

$$
\frac{x-2}{x+5}>0
$$

Critical points: $-5$ and $2$. Sign analysis gives:

$$
(-\infty,-5)\cup(2,\infty)
$$

Also note $x=-5$ is excluded automatically (division by zero).

## Graph interpretation

Domain tells you where a graph can exist on the x-axis.

1. Excluded denominator values often produce vertical asymptotes or holes.
2. Root restrictions create starting endpoints.
3. Log restrictions create hard boundaries where the graph cannot cross.

When sketching, mark domain boundaries first.

## Domain from context (word problems)

Not all restrictions are algebraic. Context can restrict inputs.

Examples:

1. Time cannot be negative.
2. Length/area cannot be negative.
3. Counts are often integers, not all real numbers.

If a formula allows a value but the scenario does not, context wins.

## Common mistakes

1. Using $\ge 0$ for log arguments (must be $>0$).
2. Forgetting denominator restrictions after simplification.
3. Union instead of intersection when combining constraints.
4. Wrong endpoint symbols in interval notation.
5. Ignoring context restrictions in applications.

## Quick self-check workflow

Before finalizing your answer:

1. List every restriction source (denominator, root, log, context).
2. Re-solve each restriction independently.
3. Rebuild domain from intersection.
4. Test one value in each included interval.
5. Test one excluded boundary value.

## Practice problems

Find the domain of each function.

1. $a(x)=\frac{3}{x+2}$
2. $b(x)=\sqrt{7-x}$
3. $c(x)=\ln(x^2-9)$
4. $d(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x+1}}{x^2-1}$
5. $e(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5-2x}}$
6. $f(x)=\ln\!\left(\frac{x+1}{x-4}\right)$

## Answer key

1. $(-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,\infty)$
2. $(-\infty,7]$
3. $(-\infty,-3)\cup(3,\infty)$
4. $[-1,1)\cup(1,\infty)$
5. $(-\infty,\tfrac{5}{2})$
6. $(-\infty,-1)\cup(4,\infty)$

## Recap

Domain is a foundational habit, not a one-off step.

If you consistently identify restrictions first, your algebra, graphing, and interpretation become more reliable. The method is always the same:

1. identify restrictions,
2. solve them,
3. intersect valid sets,
4. verify endpoints and excluded values.
